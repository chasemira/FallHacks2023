## Why we chose to make this

We wanted to make a car-pool app because so many people at SFU commute to and from school everyday. We wanted to make a differnece in the community and the environment by making it easier to car-pool with fellow SFU students helping to build a stronger sense of community whilst also reducing carbon emissions.

Our idea is for students to make postings for whenever they are going to or leaving SFU (However we have only implemented the leaving part). Other students can then see these postings and book a ride with them if they are heading in the same direction. We also have plans to add a way for people to be able to rate others on how good of a passenger/driver they were.

We hope to help students at SFU turn a new leaf by getting more involved with the community and cutting down on their wasteful carbon emissions.
